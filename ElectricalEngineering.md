# Electrical Engineering

It is important for Electrical Engineers to be familiar with the following concepts in order to practice excellent approach in design and analysis throughout their career. The course concepts listed is a brief summary and does not encapsulate the full extent of Electrical Engineering. This list reflects the concepts I learned in university. 

* Documentation (Project Execution Plan, Requirements Specification, Technical Requirements, Design Specification, Acceptance Test Plan & Test Record)
* Kirchoff's Current Law (KCL)
* Kirchoff's Voltage Law (KVL)
* Circuit Elements (resistor, capacitor, inductor, etc.)
* Nodal/Mesh Analysis
* OHM's Law (V=IR)
* Norton's Theorem
* Thevenin Equivalent Circuit
* Superposition
* Karnaugh Maps and Boolean Algebra
* State Machines (Moore and Mealy)
* Laplace, Fourier Analysis, and Complex Numbers
* Block Diagram Algebra and Transfer Functions
* Mathematical Models (Mechanical Systems, Rotational Systems, Electrical Systems)
* Routh Arrays, Root Locus Plots, Bode Diagrams, Nyquist Plots, and System Stability
* Steady State Errors
* Controllers (PI, PD, PID, Lead, Lag)
* Modulation (AM, FM, PM) and Demodulation
* Circuits (Filters, Amplifiers, Current Sources, Transistors, Logic Gates, Diodes, and Latches and Flip Flops) 
* Computer Microarchitecture
* Transformers and Transmission Lines and Power Analysis
