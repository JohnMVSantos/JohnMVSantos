- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohnMVSantos
- 👀 I’m interested in developing smart assistants which integrates both the functionalities of a large language model such as ChatGPT to produce realistic responses with real-time awareness through the use of sensors such as a camera for vision, microphone for audio input, or various API's for up to date information such as weather or current events. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to integrate machine learning in both vision and NLP with a system of sensors to achieve the desired functionality of a smart assistant that mimics human speech and goes beyond with access to up to date information with the use of APIs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on similar areas of interest which provides solutions in robotics, machine learning, and embedded systems.
